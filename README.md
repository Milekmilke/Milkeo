A new study of domestic cats has revealed which genes give felines their fur patterns. 

About 70 years ago, scientists began developing theories about patterns, like the stripes on a zebra. 

In mammals, the skin and hair cells are exactly the same across the entire body, and the color pattern comes because of differences in genetic activity. 

So the question of how cats get their stripes comes down to how and when various genes switch on in their cells.

<h2><font color="PaleVioletRed" size="6">Extra info about why cats are cute</font></h2> 

<p><font color="MediumVioletRed" size="5"> 

To most of us, cats are cute because of their almond-shaped eyes, the variety of fur colors, their small noses and paws and the adorable and funny things they do that rarely fail to entertain us. 

Cats know they're cute, and they know that you love when they're cute, and they use their feline wiles to lure you into forking over some extra snacks. 

Cats are beautiful because they have evolved to become very efficient little ambush predators, which involves a certain amount of graceful movement, which we coincidentally regard as beautiful.
